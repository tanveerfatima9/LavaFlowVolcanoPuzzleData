Embark on a fiery adventure in LavaFlow, the ultimate volcanic puzzle game that challenges your strategic thinking and problem-solving skills. Take control of molten lava erupting from a mighty volcano and guide its flow through grid-based puzzles to reach target destinations such as villages, ancient altars, and blooming gardens awaiting the volcano’s blessing. Progress through five unique levels with increasing difficulty, each featuring different layouts, obstacles, and objectives. Use a variety of strategic pipe elements to control the lava, including straight pipes to keep the flow moving, corner pipes to turn it at right angles, T-split pipes to divide the flow, cross pipes to create complex intersections, and blocking elements to stop unwanted paths. Race against time as lava cools down when traveling through empty spaces, requiring careful placement of elements to keep it flowing. Earn up to three stars per level by completing stages efficiently, reaching all targets, and using the fewest elements possible, while tracking your progress, best times, and achievements with detailed statistics. Immerse yourself in a beautiful dark theme with deep blue tones and glowing lava effects. To play, drag pipe elements from the bottom panel onto the grid, rotate them with a double-tap, create a path from the volcano to the targets, then press launch and watch the lava flow. Reach the required number of targets to complete each level. Perfect for puzzle enthusiasts, strategy lovers, and anyone seeking a unique brain-teasing experience, LavaFlow invites you to master the art of volcanic engineering and unleash the power of the volcano.
